# Flyx

## Project Description

Flyx is a simple yet powerful movie recommendation tool that matches users with the top 5 movies that resonate with their current emotions. It leverages OpenAI's text embeddings and cosine similarity to match a user's mood with appropriate movie genres.

## Features

- Emotional input: Users type in their emotions to get tailored movie recommendations.
- Top 5 recommendations: Flyx recommends the top 5 highest-rated movies within the matched genre.

## Technologies

Flyx is built with:

- Python
- Flask
- OpenAI API
- pandas
- numpy

## How to Use

1. Input your current mood in the text field.
2. Click "Get Recommendations" to receive your personalized movie recommendations.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements for Flyx include a more refined recommendation algorithm and the ability to filter movies based on more detailed preferences such as movie length, actors, etc.

## Note

Flyx is my capstone project for my course with General Assembly, I do plan on making the search more complex to allow users to search for their favourite actors or base it on the description. It is a demonstration of integration between OpenAI's advanced machine learning capabilities and a user-friendly web application.
